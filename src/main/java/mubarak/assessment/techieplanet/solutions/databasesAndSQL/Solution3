1. LEFT JOIN:
A LEFT JOIN returns all records from the left table (in this case, the games table) and the matched records from the right table
 (city table). If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the right table.

 Example SQL Query for LEFT JOIN:
 SELECT g.year, g.city, c.country
 FROM games g
 LEFT JOIN city c
 ON g.city = c.name;

 Explanation:
 This query will return all rows from the games table, even if there is no corresponding match in the city table.
 For example, if there is a year in the games table with a city that is not present in the city table
 (like the year 2032 with an empty city), the result for the country will be NULL.

 Result of LEFT JOIN:
 year	city	country
 2004	Athens	Greece
 2008	Beijing	China
 2012	London	UK
 2032	NULL	NULL


 2. RIGHT JOIN:
 A RIGHT JOIN returns all records from the right table (city table) and the matched records from the left table (games table).
 If there is no match, the result is NULL on the side of the left table.

 Example SQL Query for RIGHT JOIN:
 SELECT g.year, g.city, c.country
 FROM games g
 RIGHT JOIN city c
 ON g.city = c.name;

Explanation:
This query will return all rows from the city table, even if there is no corresponding match in the games table.
For example, if there is a city in the city table that is not present in the games table (like Sydney),
the result for the year will be NULL.

Result of RIGHT JOIN:
year	city	country
NULL	Sydney	Australia
2004	Athens	Greece
2008	Beijing	China
2012	London	UK
