## API Documentation
The API provides two endpoints, one for collecting student details and score, the other is for generating student score report by supplying the student's ID.
Below is the API request and response sample:
1. Creating Student and scores in each subject
- Endpoint: http://localhost:8080/core/techieplanet/students/create
- Method: POST
- Request Body: JSON object with three properties: firstName, lastName and subjectScores.
- Example Request Body:
  {
  "firstName": "Mubarak",
  "lastName": "Techplanet",
  "subjectScores": {
  "Mathematics": 85,
  "English": 90,
  "Science": 78,
  "History": 76,
  "Art": 90
  }
  }

ApiResponse

The application's RESTful API returns responses in the form of an `ApiResponse` object. Below is the sample of a successful response:
{
"code": 200,
"status": true,
"message": "SUCCESSFUL",
"error": null,
"data": 3
}
The value of data in the above response is the student's Id, which will be used to test the second endpoint.

2. Generating score report for already created student
